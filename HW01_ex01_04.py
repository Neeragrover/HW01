# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. 
# Pythons syntax for math operations is almost the same as 
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols 
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. 
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your 
# average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? 
# (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).
# Average Speed in MPH:

distance_in_km=10
distance_in_miles=distance_in_km/1.61
time_in_hrs=43.5/60
average_miles_per_hour=distance_in_miles/time_in_hrs
print average_miles_per_hour
